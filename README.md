# Rockbuster Stealth 

In this project, I created a presentation for the Rockbuster Stealth management team ahead of the company's plan to launch an online video rental service. Presented here are examples of my SQL queries, an excel file containing my SQL queries for technical colleagues, a data dictionary, and my presentation to management.



## Key Objectives 

Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

What was the average rental duration for all videos?

Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
